# Runtime OSD Parameters

These parameters only apply to OSDs, are not fixed at the moment of OSD drive
initialization and can be changed - in /etc/vitastor/vitastor.conf or [vitastor-disk update-sb](../usage/disk.en.md#update-sb)
with an OSD restart or, for some of them, even without restarting by updating configuration in etcd.
